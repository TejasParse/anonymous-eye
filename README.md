## Anonymous Eye

People even now are still scared to complain about the crime happening to them or others in a police station. That's when i came up to this solution. Many state police websites do not have this feature to allow users to complaint anonymously so i choose to make this website.

This website will allow anyone to report about any crime happening to them or near by without tracking any information about the user

As a police officer you can Go Through the cases
Then if you want to pick up the case pick it up and also collaborate with other officers who took it up
Then if the case is solved update it on the website
So there are 3 states where a complaint can be

To use this do the following

First install all the node modules using "npm install"

Then run the mongoDB using "mongod" command and keep it aside as this uses local mongodb

Then run the seed.js file to get the login credentials as a police officer

Then run the app.js file

Use the website at 

http://localhost:3000
